# researchfunctions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of researchfunctions is to allow me to keep all my functions for my project in one place.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dakthomps00/researchfunctions")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

Say we want to get confidence intervals of effect sizes for random normally distributed data sets we would do this

```{r example}
library(researchfunctions)

cohen <- replicate(10000, cohensd(75,0,1,1))
mad <- replicate(10000, deltamad(75,0,1,1))

confidint(cohen, 75)
confidint(mad,75)
```
