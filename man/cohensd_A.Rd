\description{
Generates the mean of the contaminated group, the standard deviation of the contaminated group, and Cohen's d effect size for one randomly distributed data set against a normal data set contaminated with another normal data set with defined characteristics (number of subjects, percent of subjects with x mean and y standard deviation, percent of subjects with z mean and a standard deviation, mean of the first data set, x mean, z mean, standard deviation of the second data set, y standard deviation, and a standard deviation)
